# VLAN-ACL. VACL can be applied to IP-address or MAC-address.
Configurarion:
Step 1.a: Configure standatd/extended IP ACL

ip access-list extended Vlan100-TCP
 permit tcp any any
ip access-list extended Vlan100-UDP
 permit udp any any

Step 1.b: Configure extended MAC ACL

mac access-list extended Sw-ALS2
 permit host 0c36.12ee.80c8 any     # Remmember to clear arp-cache on the switch to take affect of MAC-address filtering
 
Step 2: Configure Vlan access map
 
vlan access-map VLAN100 10
 match ip address Vlan100-TCP
 action drop
vlan access-map VLAN100 20
 match ip address Vlan100-UDP
 action drop
vlan access-map VLAN100 30
 action forward

Step 3: Apply Vlan access map to the VLAN

vlan filter VLAN100 vlan-list 100
vlan filter VLAN200 vlan-list 200

Verification commands:
show access-lists [number/name]
show ip access-lists [number/name]
show vlan access-map
show vlan filter vlan [number]
show vlan filter access-map [name]
