Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) depends on the entries in the DHCP
Snooping binding database to verify IP-to-MAC address bindings in incoming
ARP requests and ARP responses. However, when DHCP Snooping is
disabled or in non-DHCP environments, you must use ARP ACLs to permit
or to deny packets

# Dynamic ARP Inspection without DHCP Snooping binding database

Configuration:
Step 1: Configure ARP-ACL, which maps IP-address to MAC-address

  arp access-list VLAN100-DAI
    permit ip host 100.1.1.2 mac host 0c36.124d.8064
 
Step 2: Link ARP-ACL to VLAN

  ip arp inspection filter VLAN100-DAI vlan 100 static

Step 3: Enable ARP Inspection on VLAN

  ip arp inspection vlan 100

Step 4: Enable logging, to log hits on the ACL

  ip arp inspection vlan 100 logging acl-match matchlog

Step 5: Select method of ARP inspection validation. It can be: ip dst-mac / ip src-mac

  ip arp inspection validate ip src-mac
  
Step 6: Configure trusted interfaces, which usually are trunk interfaces. By default, all interfaces are untrusted.
  
 interface g0/1
  ip arp inspection trust

Step 7: Remmember to clear arp-cache on the switch after configuration is finished using command
  
  clear arp-cache
  clear arp-cache interface [interface-id]


Verification Commands:
  show ip arp inspection
  show ip arp inspection vlan 100
  show ip arp inspection interfaces
